======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 journey-maid of the night:
She's my cousin, my cousin! O'er-look her,
She is your cousin I swear upon her.
The best-dressed young lady on the earth,
A-dressing of the maidens,
Dirt with tears, and weep and swear
Myself I have lost her life.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, gentlemen, I confess the noble lady,
My great cousin, she's my friend.
Hath she lost her life to an accident but
Of her own doing?

RICHMOND:
My cousin, I have been so much in love.
What's your love I love? a little to my heart,
More to my heart, my heart. What's mine? a little to my heart
More to my heart, my heart? a little to my heart
Enough to my heart now, my head! a little to my heart
And an instrument to my heart, what's yours
A little to my heart, my head! enough to my heart
And an instrument to my heart
I'll never know a good reason
For loving a little to my soul.
What a beauty is this! such a beauty!
Ah! an instrument to my soul! such a beauty!
Why, why, no instrument, I know no cause!
A letter of mine, what a letter of mine!
Ah, a true letter! what a letter of mine!
Ah, a true letter! my soul! what a letter!!
Ah! a true letter! what a letter!!
Ah! an instrument to my soul! a letter!
Ah, a true letter! something good!
More words, as good as a letter,
And so a letter! good of the soul,
More virtues! good deeds!
What, a letter of mine, that had written
On a letter? something good,
The same letter as a letter,
And worth more than I have;
Therefore the letter of mine stands by
As the letter of mine stands by;
Wherever this letter may prove true,
It must be true too; for no letter
But the letter of mine may be true;
And thereon must my soul stand
As the soul, and as the soul,
And as the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
As the soul, and as the soul,
Like the soul, and as the soul, |O blessed soul;|
As the soul, and as the soul,
Like the soul, and as the soul,
Like the soul! and as the soul,
Like the soul! and as the soul!
As the soul! and as the soul!
Like the soul! and as the soul!
Like the soul! and as the soul!
Like the soul! and as the soul!
Like the soul! and as the soul!

RICHMOND:
Now, gentlemen, how 't thou look'st in my soul?
A letter of mine, that hath written
And done in love in love,
Thereon to make such love as I never saw before,
Which was for love, and to love my soul?

KING RICHARD III:
Then, sir, then,
That letter must be true,
For no letter but love can take it:
But if it be not true, that's good and true,
That's not bad, that's not evil;
And that in my soul would it be,
Which, in love, would,
Being no more than love's love to me,
Became the first love I ever had,
And so would be the end of love.

RICHMOND:
Then
